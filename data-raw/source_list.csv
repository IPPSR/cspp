In these cases, author merely assumed that a governor who was sitting in a state with a one term term limit when a constitutional amendment passed creating a two term term limit would be eligible for a second term. If a governor was sitting in a state with no term limits, when a constitutional amendment passed that created a two term term limit author assumed that the counter would start when the constitutional amendment passed. Some of the state specific notes for this variable may not appear below, but in the document 'GovTermLimits-PrimaryDocuments.' If the term limit in NC in 1997 was an absolute limit, then James B.

Notes: The number of ineligible felons depends on state law. Some states permanently disfranchise felons and a few let even prisoners vote. Statistics drawn from various Department of Justice reports which detail the prison, probation, and parole population of the United States are matched with these state laws to estimate the number of ineligible felons. The Department of Justice Bureau, Office of Justice Statistics releases numbers from Jan. 1 through Dec. 31 for a given year. Author uses the most approximate Jan. 1 values, where available, since these include revised Dec. 31 data from the previous year. Author assumes all Prisoners and Parolees are felons, and half of Probationers are felons (this estimate is drawn from DOJ reports; starting in 2011, DOJ reports the number of persons on probation who are felons). A blank or zero indicates the category of felons is allowed to vote in that state. For the United States totals, author includes persons in the federal corrections system.",NA,NA,NA,NA

The Vote for Highest Office is the traditional reported number of people who voted in a given election. In presidential election years, the vote for highest office is simply the presidential vote. In a non-presidential election year, the vote for highest office is the largest vote total for a statewide office such as governor or US Senator. When no statewide office is on the ballot, the sum of the congressional races is used instead. In 2006, the methodology was changed slightly to use the sum of the congressional races if they exceeded a statewide office, as occurred with Indiana’s uncompetitive US Senate race.",NA,NA,NA,NA

WARNING: users can drop the even years in even year states if they don’t like the one-fourth/one-half/one-fourth weighting referred to above. For states with four-year election cycles, like Alabama, users might consider only keeping the values from three years after the calendar year of the election. Candidates in FFA-MMDs have their % multiplied by the number of seats in the FFA-MMD. After computing this quantity for both chambers, those two quantities are averaged.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Notes: For the Holbrook and Van Dunk data, the data were first worked on with the state-chamber-year as the unit of analysis. Running averages of the four dimensions were created that were weighted by the number of seats up in each chamber (running averages of four, six, eight and ten years). The four dimensions were then averaged (and subtracted from '100') to make the Holbrook and Van Dunk indicator for a chamber-year. The values from the two chambers were then averaged.",NA,NA,NA,NA

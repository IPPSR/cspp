# cspp 0.3.1

* Added a new function, plot_panel, that visualizes the data from the package.

* Edited the existing get_cspp_data function to include a new argument (core) that allows users to merge a set of common variables into the result of their search request regardless of whether it matches those variables.

* Added integration with csppData, a package we created to hold the Correlates of State Policy Project data and codebook.

Description: A tool that imports, subsets, visualizes, and exports the Correlates of State Policy Project dataset assembled by Marty P. Jordan and Matt Grossmann (2020) <http://ippsr.msu.edu/public-policy/correlates-state-policy>. The Correlates data contains over 2000 variables across more than 100 years that pertain to state politics and policy in the United States. Users with only a basic understanding of R can subset this data across multiple dimensions, export their search results, create map visualizations, export the citations associated with their searches, and more.
